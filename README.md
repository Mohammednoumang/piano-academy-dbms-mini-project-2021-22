# Piano academy dbms mini project using php and mysql
 
1. Use xampp application for this project.
2. Copy the Piano folder to "htdocs" in lampp of xampp directory.
3. Note: The database name should be "some" or else it will show errors.
4. Import the sql file named "some.sql" to phpmyadmin with database name "some" to get the database tables.
5. You can change the database name but then you have to change the database name in all .php files. I would recommend you do not change the database name.
6. Go to the browser and type your localhost, folder name and then piano.php to start the web page.
	For Example: localhost:8080/Piano/piano.php
